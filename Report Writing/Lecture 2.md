>
> Best regards,  
> Amr Khaled  
> Computer Science Student, ASU
> ```

## 3. Subject Line Tips 🟢
> [!note]
> The **subject line** should summarize the email’s purpose in a few words.

### Tips
- Be clear, short, and specific (max 7–8 words).  
- Avoid vague or empty titles (e.g., *Hi*, *Question*, *Help!*).  
- Use action or topic keywords.

> [!example]
> ✅ *Meeting Agenda for Thursday, Oct 31*  
> ❌ *Important!!!* or *Quick Question*

## 4. Greeting and Salutation 🟢
> [!note]
> A professional greeting shows respect and sets the tone for your email.

| Context | Appropriate Greeting |
|----------|----------------------|
| Academic | Dear Dr./Professor [Last Name], |
| Workplace | Dear Mr./Ms. [Last Name], |
| Semi-Formal | Hello [First Name], |

> [!warning]
> Avoid “Hey,” “Hiya,” or using no greeting at all in formal emails.

## 5. Writing the Body of the Email 🟡

### Tips for a Clear Body
- Start with your purpose in the first line.  
- Use **short paragraphs** (2–3 sentences each).  
- Be polite and professional; avoid slang or abbreviations.  
- Use bullet points or numbering when listing.  
- Keep sentences clear and focused.

> [!example]
> ```
> Dear Professor,
>
> I would like to request feedback on my research proposal before next week’s submission.  
> Please let me know if you are available for a short meeting on Thursday morning.
>
> Thank you in advance for your time.
>
> Best regards,  
> Amr
> ```

## 6. Closing and Signature 🟢
> [!note]
> A courteous closing reinforces professionalism and respect.

### Common Closings
| Formal | Semi-Formal |
|--------|--------------|
| Best regards, | Kind regards, |
| Sincerely, | Thank you, |
| Yours faithfully, | Yours truly, |

### Signature Example
> [!example]

### Guidelines
- Avoid **ALL CAPS** and multiple exclamation marks.  
- Be polite even in disagreement.  
- Use neutral phrasing instead of emotional language.  
- Tailor tone to context (academic vs. business).

> [!example]
> ✅ *“Could you please review the attached document by Friday?”*  
> ❌ *“Please check this ASAP!!!”*

> [!warning]
