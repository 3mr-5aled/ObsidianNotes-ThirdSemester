## Why is Email Important?
- Prevalent in daily life.  
- Fast and cheap communication.  
- Many use email without understanding how it works.  
- Business context: ~100 emails/day → must be clear and precise.  

---

## Know Your Purpose
- Clear emails always have a clear purpose.  
- Ask yourself:  
  - *Why am I sending this?*  
  - *What do I need from the recipient?*  
- If you cannot answer, don’t send.  
- Also ask: *Is this email necessary?*  

---

## One Thing Rule
- Emails ≠ business meetings.  
- Focus on **one topic per email**.  
- Use multiple emails if necessary.  
- Less is better.  

---

## Practice Empathy
- Consider words from the reader’s perspective.  
- Most people:  
  - Are busy.  
  - Appreciate compliments.  
  - Like being thanked.  
- Consider time zones for international emails.  
- Treat others how you’d like to be treated.

## Structure of an Email
1. **To / From fields**  
   - Use proper and professional email addresses.  
   - Example: `sallysaad@cis.asu.edu.eg`  
   - Avoid *unprofessional* ones like `FlyingEagle@yahoo.com`.  
1. **Subject line**  
   - Always include a brief, descriptive subject.  
   - Avoid “No subject” → may be flagged as spam.  
   - Capitalization rules:  
     - Capitalize each major word, OR  
     - Capitalize first word + proper nouns.  
   - Modify subject when conversation direction changes.  
   - Examples:  
     - ✅ *Technology Expenses Report Q2 2007*  
     - ❌ *Hi.*

## Salutation
- Proper greetings make email less demanding.  
- Spell names correctly.  

### Single Recipient
| Context | Salutation |
|---------|------------|
| Unknown person | *To Whom It May Concern*, *Dear Sir/Madam* |
| Formal | *Dear Mr. Smith* |
| Colleague | *Dear James* |
| Informal (acceptable) | *Hello James,* |
| Too casual (avoid) | *Hi James,* |

### Multiple Recipients
| Context | Salutation |
|---------|------------|
| Multiple recipients | *Good Morning*, *Good Afternoon* |
| All male group | *Dear Sirs*, *Dear Gentlemen* |
| Peers, not seniors | *Dear Colleagues* |
| Two recipients | *Dear Tim and Jane* |
| General | *Dear all*, *Dears* |
| Informal (avoid) | *Hi*, *Hello* |

---

## Content
- Identify yourself (if unknown).  
- State purpose clearly.  
- Include all necessary details.  
- Be specific, avoid generalities.  
- Keep it short (one screen).  
- Review before sending.  

---

## Tone
- Read out loud to check tone.  
- Avoid over-reliance on formatting.  
- If emotional, wait before replying.  
- Re-read sender’s content to avoid misinterpretation.  

---

## Formality
- Formality = respect.  
- Start formal, adjust as relationship evolves.  
- Avoid being too informal too soon.  

---

## Language
- Spell-check.  
- Use proper grammar and punctuation.  
- Write in full sentences.  
- No slang.  

---

## Formatting
- ❌ ALL CAPS = shouting.  
- ❌ all lowercase = unprofessional.  
- ❌ Fancy fonts, multiple colors, patterned backgrounds.  
- ❌ Overusing emoticons/emojis (better avoid).  

---

## Good Manners
- Avoid multiple `!!!` or `???`.  
- Use *please*, *kindly*, *thank you*.  

---

## Closing
| Context | Closing |
|---------|---------|
| Very formal (avoid with known contacts) | *Sincerely,* |
| Safe, general | *Regards,* |
| Appreciation | *Thank you,* |
| Casual | *Thanks,* |
| Close relation | No closing, just name |

---

## Signature
- Use consistent font.  
- Include title + department.  
- Optionally add company website.  
- Add phone only if available and answered professionally.

## Attachments

- Scan for viruses.
    
- Prefer multiple small emails instead of one with many attachments.
    
- Ensure recipient can open file.
    
- Use descriptive filenames.
    
- Compress large files.
    
- **Never send attachments without body text.**
    

---

## To vs CC vs BCC

- **To** → recipients expected to act/respond.
    
- **CC (Carbon Copy)** → awareness only, no response required.
    
- **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)** → hidden recipients.
    

**Guidelines:**

- Don’t overuse CC.
    
- Use BCC to protect privacy.
    
- Never expose emails publicly.
    

---

## Read Receipt (RR)

- Not for every email.
    
- Use only for **critical or time-sensitive** messages.
    
- Excessive use = intrusive.
    
- Consider phone for urgent matters.
    

---

## Guidelines for Reply

- Acknowledge emails within **48h**.
    
- If delayed → confirm receipt and give expected reply time.
    
- Don’t start a new subject by replying to an old thread.
    
- Check _Junk/Trash_ before assuming no reply.
    

---

## Emotional Emails

- Don’t assume intent.
    
- Wait before sending emotionally charged replies.
    

---

## Reply All

- Use only if all recipients must be involved.
    
- Otherwise, reply only to necessary people.
    

---

## Forwarding Guidelines

- Don’t forward chain letters.
    
- Confirm interest before forwarding.
    
- Add personal comment.
    
- Remove clutter (`>>>>`, headers, old addresses).
    
- Use BCC for bulk forwards.
    
- Be cautious with political/controversial issues.
    
- If misinformation forwarded → send correction/apology.
    

---

## Instant Messaging Etiquette

- Ask availability before messaging.
    
- Keep IM short.
    
- Longer topics → use email or phone.
    
- Don’t keep others waiting.
    
- Revise wording before sending (especially to seniors).
