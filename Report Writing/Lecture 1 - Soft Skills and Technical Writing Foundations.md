## Writing Tips
- Having a **unique personal writing style** guarantees **poor technical writing**.
    
- **Avoid writing as you might speak**.
    
- **Use simple, direct sentences**.
    
- **Balance brevity and completeness** — be concise without omitting key details.
    
- **Do not underestimate layout and design**; visual clarity improves comprehension.
    
- **Choose sentence length carefully**:
    
    - Ideal length: **10–15 words**.
        
    - Never go below **7 words** or beyond **20 words** for readability.
        
    - Very short sentences may appear **cheap or abrupt**; overly long ones become **confusing**.
        
- **Never use “I”** in technical writing; maintain **objectivity**.
    
- **Avoid strong words** (e.g., “always,” “never,” “perfect,” “best”).
    
- **Avoid big or complex words** when simpler alternatives exist.
