## Chapter 7 – ER-to-Relational Mapping Algorithm

> [!summary]
> The **ER-to-Relational Mapping Algorithm** converts an **ER schema** into a **relational schema**.  
> It ensures that all entities, attributes, and relationships are represented as tables with appropriate keys and constraints.

---

### **Step 1: Mapping of Regular Entity Types**
- Create a **relation** (table) for each **regular entity type**.
- Include all **simple attributes** as columns.
- Choose one **key attribute** as the **primary key (PK)**.
- **Composite attributes** are broken into their components.
- **Multivalued attributes** are not included here (handled in Step 6).

> [!example]
> `EMPLOYEE(Fname, Minit, Lname, SSN, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Super_ssn, Dno)`

---

### **Step 2: Mapping of Weak Entity Types**
- Create a **separate relation** for each **weak entity**.
- Include a **foreign key (FK)** to the **identifying entity**’s relation.
- The **PK** of the weak entity = combination of its **partial key + identifying FK**.

> [!example]
> `DEPENDENT(Essn, Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate, Relationship)`  
> - `Essn` → FK referencing `EMPLOYEE.SSN`  
> - PK = `(Essn, Dependent_name)`

---

### **Step 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship Types**

There are **three approaches**:

1. **Foreign Key Approach:**  
   - Add FK from one entity (its PK) to the other.  
   - Prefer to take the entity with **total participation** to put fk.

   > [!example]
   > MANAGES(Dept_no → FK in DEPARTMENT referencing EMPLOYEE)

2. **Merged Relation Approach:**  
   - Merge both entities and the relationship into one table.  
   - Use when **both participations are total**.

3. **Cross-Reference Table:**  
   - Create a new relation for the relationship.
   - Contains PKs from both participating entities as FKs.

> [!tip]
> ✅ Prefer the **FK approach** for simplicity unless merging is required by design.

---

### **Step 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types**
- Add FK to the **N-side** entity’s relation.
- Include **any relationship attributes** as columns.
  
> [!example]
> `EMPLOYEE` includes `Dno` (FK referencing `DEPARTMENT.Dnumber`) to represent the **WORKS_FOR** relationship.

> [!mermaid]
> ```mermaid
> erDiagram
>     DEPARTMENT ||--o{ EMPLOYEE : WORKS_FOR
>     DEPARTMENT {
>         int Dnumber PK
>         string Dname
>     }
>     EMPLOYEE {
>         int SSN PK
>         string Name
>         int Dno FK
>     }
> ```

---

### **Step 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types**
- Create a **new relation** to represent the M:N relationship.
- Include:
  - FKs from both participating entities.
  - Any relationship attributes.
- The **PK** is the combination of the two FKs.

> [!example]
> `WORKS_ON(Essn, Pno, Hours)`  
> - FKs: `Essn → EMPLOYEE`, `Pno → PROJECT`  
> - PK = `{Essn, Pno}`

---

### **Step 6: Mapping of Multivalued Attributes**
- Create a **new relation** for each multivalued attribute.
- Include:
  - Attribute value column.
  - FK referencing the entity’s PK.
- PK = combination of both.

> [!example]
> `DEPT_LOCATIONS(Dnumber, Dlocation)`  
> - Represents multivalued attribute `LOCATIONS` of `DEPARTMENT`

---

### **Step 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types (n > 2)**
- Create a new **relation** for the n-ary relationship.
- Include:
  - FKs referencing each participating entity.
  - Relationship’s own attributes.
- PK = combination of all FKs.

> [!example]
> `SUPPLY(Sname, Part_no, Proj_name, Quantity)`  
> - Represents ternary relationship **SUPPLY(SUPPLIER, PART, PROJECT)**  
> - PK = `{Sname, Part_no, Proj_name}`

> [!mermaid]
> ```mermaid
> erDiagram
>     SUPPLIER ||--o{ SUPPLY : supplies
>     PROJECT ||--o{ SUPPLY : receives
>     PART ||--o{ SUPPLY : includes
> ```

---

### **Summary of Mapping Constructs**

| ER Model Concept             | Relational Model Equivalent             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Entity type                  | Entity relation                         |
| 1:1 / 1:N relationship       | Foreign key or relationship relation     |
| M:N relationship             | Relationship relation + 2 FKs            |
| n-ary relationship           | Relationship relation + n FKs            |
| Simple attribute             | Column                                  |
| Composite attribute          | Set of component columns                 |
| Multivalued attribute        | Separate relation + FK                   |
| Key attribute                | Primary key                             |

> [!question]
> - Why do we prefer placing the FK on the total participation side in 1:1 relationships?  
> - What issues arise if a multivalued attribute is not normalized into a separate table?

---

### **Main Takeaways**
- Every ER construct maps systematically into a relational schema.  
- Proper placement of keys maintains referential integrity.  
- N-ary and multivalued attributes require separate relations.

## Chapter 4 – Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Modeling

> [!summary]
> **EER Modeling** extends the ER model to include **inheritance, specialization, and generalization**—allowing more precise conceptual representation.

---

### **Key Concepts**
- **Superclass/Subclass** hierarchy
- **Specialization / Generalization**
- **Attribute and Relationship Inheritance**
- **Disjointness and Completeness Constraints**
- **Shared Subclasses (Multiple Inheritance)**

---

### **Subclasses and Superclasses**
- A **subclass** is a subset of entities from a **superclass**.
- Each subclass may have:
  - **Local attributes** (specific to subclass)
  - **Local relationships**

> [!example]
> - `EMPLOYEE` superclass → subclasses: `ENGINEER`, `MANAGER`, `TECHNICIAN`, etc.  
> - Each inherits `Name`, `SSN`, etc., from `EMPLOYEE`.

> [!mermaid]
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>   EMPLOYEE --> ENGINEER
>   EMPLOYEE --> MANAGER
>   EMPLOYEE --> TECHNICIAN
> ```

---

### **Attribute Inheritance**
- Each subclass **inherits**:
  - All attributes of superclass.
  - All relationships of superclass.

> [!tip]
> **Inheritance rule:**  
> If `SECRETARY` is a subclass of `EMPLOYEE`, every `SECRETARY` entity **must** also be an `EMPLOYEE`.

![[Pasted image 20251027235059.png]]

---

### **Specialization**
- **Definition:** Process of defining subclasses from a superclass based on distinguishing characteristics.  
- **Top-down approach.**

> [!example]
> `{SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}` = specialization of `EMPLOYEE` based on `JobType`.

![[Pasted image 20251027235200.png]]

---

### **Generalization**
- **Definition:** Reverse of specialization; combines multiple entity types into a superclass.  
- **Bottom-up approach.**

> [!example]
> `CAR` and `TRUCK` → generalized into `VEHICLE`.

> [!mermaid]
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>   CAR --> VEHICLE
>   TRUCK --> VEHICLE
> ```

![[Pasted image 20251027235217.png]]

---

### **Constraints in EER**

#### **1. Disjointness Constraint**
- **Disjoint (d):** An entity can belong to only one subclass.  
- **Overlapping (o):** Entity may belong to multiple subclasses.

#### **2. Completeness Constraint**
- **Total (double line):** Every superclass entity must belong to a subclass. 
- **Partial (single line):** Some superclass entities may not belong to any subclass.

![[Pasted image 20251027235352.png]]

> [!example]
> - Disjoint total → every `EMPLOYEE` is either a `MANAGER` or `ENGINEER`, not both.  
> - Overlapping partial → some `EMPLOYEES` belong to none or multiple subclasses.

---

### **Hierarchies, Lattices, and Shared Subclasses**
- **Hierarchy:** Subclass has **one superclass** (single inheritance).  
- **Lattice:** Subclass can have **multiple superclasses** (multiple inheritance).  
- **Shared subclass:** Appears under more than one superclass.

> [!example]
> `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` = subclass of both `ENGINEER` and `MANAGER`.

> [!mermaid]
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>   ENGINEER --> ENGINEERING_MANAGER
>   MANAGER --> ENGINEERING_MANAGER
> ```

### **Types of Specialization/Generalization**

| Type | Disjointness | Completeness |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Disjoint Total | d | Total |
| Disjoint Partial | d | Partial |
| Overlapping Total | o | Total |
| Overlapping Partial | o | Partial |

> [!question]
> - How does multiple inheritance affect database schema design?  
> - Why is specialization considered a top-down conceptual refinement?

---

### **Mnemonic**
> **“SDHTGC” → Steps Define Hierarchy, Then Generalize Carefully**  
> Helps remember the EER progression:  
> **S**pecialization → **D**isjointness → **H**ierarchy → **T**otality → **G**eneralization → **C**ompleteness
